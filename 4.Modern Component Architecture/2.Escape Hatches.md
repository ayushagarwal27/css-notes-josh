# Escape Hatches

- No matter how much preparation we do, we will always discover additional needs once we start using the component in our application. Sometimes, it's a matter of updating the standard to include an additional tweakable parameter. Other times, a special situation will call for special one-off handling.

## Composition

- I like to follow a similar motto when it comes to building reusable components: **it should be easy to follow the convention, and hard (but possible!) to break free of it**.

- The world is messy, and we will need to break with convention sometimes. Designs call for exceptions. If the component can't flex, we'll need to build a new one from scratch. And the end result will be an even-less-consistent user interface.

- This framework — easy to follow the convention, possible to break free of it — has served me really well over the years.
