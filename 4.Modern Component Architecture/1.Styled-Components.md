# styled-components

- We can name topmost element as Wrapper

- naming elements not in terms of underlying HTML elements, but the meaning in which they are currently being used

## Global Styles

- With styled-components, the styles we write are indelibly bound to the elements created. In a component-driven framework like React, this is exactly what you want, most of the time.

- styled-components has a specific API for creating global styles:

```js
// GlobalStyles.js
import  { createGlobalStyle }  from  'styled-components';
```

- This API is remarkably similar to the `styled` helpers we've seen so far: it's called using a tagged template literal, and it returns a component we can render in our app:

-  When the  `GlobalStyles`  component is rendered, it will inject all of its CSS into the  `<head>`  of the document, applying those styles.

- It doesn't really matter where you render this component; there is no significant advantage to putting it above or below the rest of your app's content. I normally include it in my top-level  `App`  component, so that I know it's  _always_  being rendered, and I put it below the rest of the JSX in that component so that it's out of the way.

### Resetting styles

 1. **Reset** - flatten the CSS, removes browser defaults, any decorations
 2. **Global Styles** - which we want throughout the applications
 3. **Overriding third party library styles** - if any

- Not setting any component styles
- Try to keep it minimal
