# Anatomy of a Style Rule
- Properties in CSS are the attributes you can specify values for, like "color" and "font-size".

- A selector is a descriptor that lets you target specific elements on the page. For example .apple

- A declaration is a combination of a property and a value. For example a property of "padding", and a value of "32px".

- A rule, also known as a style, is a collection of declarations, targeting one or more selectors. A stylesheet is made up of multiple rules.
```css
p {
  color:  red;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```
- Some values have units, like px, %, or em. For example, our padding-top has a value of 24px, which is measured in the "px" unit.
