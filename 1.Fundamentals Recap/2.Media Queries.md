# Media Queries

- In order to accommodate screens of different shapes and sizes, CSS features **media queries**, which allow us to apply different CSS in different scenarios

- Media queries use the  `@media`  syntax. You can kinda think of it as an  `if`  statement in JavaScript:

```js
// JavaScript
if  (condition)  {
  // Some JS that will run if the condition is met.
}
```
```css
/* CSS */
@media  (condition)  {
  /* Some CSS that'll run if the condition is met. */
}
```
- `display: none` is a declaration that removes an element from the rendering process; it's as if it doesn't exist.

## Valid conditions

- Inside the parentheses, we typically use either `max-width` to add styles on small screens, or `min-width` to add styles on larger ones.

- The syntax looks quite a lot like the declaration syntax, especially since  `max-width: 1023px`  is a valid CSS declaration! Unfortunately, this is misleading; In the context of a media query,  `max-width`  is a ‚Äúmedia feature‚Äù, not a CSS property. They just happen to share the same name.

Not all CSS properties have corresponding media features. For example, this snippet is not valid:
```css
/* üö´ Not valid, since `font-size` can't be queried */
@media  (font-size:  32px)  {
}
```
