# Combinators
- The term “combinator” refers to a character that combines multiple selectors. 
```
 nav a
```
- In this case, the space character combines `nav` and `a` to create a **descendant selector**.

- The descendant selector will apply to all descendants, no matter how deeply nested they are.

- In CSS, we can differentiate between _children_ and _descendants_. Think of a family tree: a child is only one level down from the parent. A descendant might be 1 level down (child), 2 levels down (grandchild), 3 levels down…

- **Target direct children**, and not deeper descendants :-
```
.main-item > li
```
