# Color

## Color formats

CSS includes many different ways to represent color.

 - **Keywords** - red
	 - Not to be used in real application
	 
 - **HEX Code** - #FF0000
	 - Three different values of 2 digits each
	 - red, green, blue
	 - 16 possible values
	 
 - **RGB** - rgb(255, 0, 0)
	 - red, green, blue
	 - 255 possible value
	 
 - **HSL** - hsl (0deg, 100%, 50%) 
	 - Hue - degrees (what color is being used)
	 - Saturation - how grayed out or vibrant the color is
	 - Lightness - lighter or darker
	- The first number has the `deg` suffix since it's in degrees (from 0° to 360°), and the next two numbers are percentages (from 0% to 100%).

## Transparency

- Certain color formats allow us to supply an additional value for the  _alpha channel_.

- This is a measure of opacity. At 1 (default), the color is fully opaque and solid. At 0, the color is invisible. We can specify decimal values to create a semi-transparent color.

```css
 background-color: hsl(340deg 100% 50% / 0.75);
```
