# Rendering Contexts

- When we set `transform-style: preserve-3d`, we opt into a different stacking algorithm. Instead of being based purely on stacking contexts and `z-index` layers, we _position the elements in 3D space!_

- With `transform-style: preserve-3d`, the `z-index` property can still be used to set the default position, but the moment we start tilting or moving an item in 3D space, that takes precedence.

- **This is a big deal.** It essentially gives us a legit 3D engine to work with in CSS! We can do things that aren't otherwise possible with `z-index`

## 3D rendering contexts

- When we apply `transform-style: preserve-3d`, we create a **3D rendering context**.

- It's a bit like how certain CSS properties like `position: fixed` create a _stacking_ context. With `transform-style: preserve-3d`, we allow the element's children to be repositioned in 3D space. When one element moves closer, it'll be painted above its siblings in the 3D rendering context.

- I feel like it's really easy to get `perspective` and `transform-style` mixed up, but they accomplish different goals:

  - `perspective` is all about the visuals of how items are presented. By default, CSS uses _orthographic projection_, like that “Where's Waldo?” drawing, but we can flip to _perspective projection_ with the `perspective` attribute.
  - `transform-style` creates a 3D rendering context, which allows items to be moved around in 3D space, changing which elements show up “in front”, and allowing elements to intersect.

- We've already seen what happens when we set `perspective` without setting `transform-style`: elements will appear to rotate and move in 3D space, but it's a purely visual effect. The layering / paint order is still determined by things like `z-index` and DOM order.

- And if we set `transform-style` without setting `perspective`, elements can move in 3D space, but they still appear flat

## Gotchas

**Here's the problem:** the `transform-style` property is _not inheritable_. It creates a 3D rendering context, but only _direct children_ can participate in this context by default.

- `transform-style: preserve-3d` acts as a sort of bridge, allowing descendants to participate in an ancestor's 3D rendering context. We can repeat this trick as many times as we wish; as long as each layer sets `transform-style: preserve-3d`, the 3D rendering context will be chained along.

- _What about `perspective`?_ This property isn't inheritable either, but fortunately, we don't have to worry about it. The perspective applies directly to the 3D rendering context. As long as our descendants have access to the 3D rendering context, the perspective will apply automatically.

- If you find yourself running into this bug, and you're not sure how to fix it, **I have a quick set of steps you can follow:**

  1.  Locate the ancestor that creates the 3D rendering context (this will be the element that sets `perspective`).
  2.  Locate the descendant that applies a 3D transform (eg. `transform: rotateX()`).
  3.  Apply the following CSS declaration to each element between the two: `transform-style: preserve-3d;`. This will ensure that the 3D rendering context is passed through all the layers, and can be used by the transformed descendant.

**The “inherit” keyword(success)**

- Instead of setting `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the child, we can also use the special `inherit` keyword:

```css
.wrapper {
  perspective: 500px;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.card-link {
  transform-style: inherit;
}
```

- There are a _whole bunch_ of CSS properties that, when applied to the same element, will disable the 3D rendering context.

- The list includes:

  - `overflow`
  - `clip-path`
  - `opacity`
  - `filter`
  - `mix-blend-mode`# Rendering Contexts
