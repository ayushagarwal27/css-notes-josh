# Grid Quirks

## Row limit

**Update: the limit has been increased!**

- Starting in Chrome 96, released in November 2021, the grid row limit has been bumped to 100,000 rows!

- That said, we shouldn't  _actually_  try and render that many items; Google recommends not exceeding 1500 DOM nodes, on the entire page! If you have a massive dataset that you want to render, you can use  **virtualization.**

- Virtualization is an advanced technique that uses JS to remove DOM nodes not currently on-screen. It's beyond the scope of this course. For React devs, I recommend  [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)

## Margin collapse

- As in Flexbox, the margin on grid children won't collapse, in either direction
- Margin collapse is a feature of Flow layout

## Z-index works with grid children
- `z-index` can be used to control the stacking order of elements in the same stacking context.

- Normally, `z-index` only works in _positioned layout_: the element needs to set `position` to `relative`/`absolute`/`fixed`/`sticky`. But an exception has been carved out for CSS Grid: A grid child can use `z-index` even if it doesn't change the `position` property.

- By setting `z-index` on a grid child, it will create a stacking context.
