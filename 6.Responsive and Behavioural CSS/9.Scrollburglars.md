# Scrollburglars

- A scrollburglar is my cute made-up name for a common phenomenon: A webpage has an accidental horizontal scrollbar that allows you to scroll by a few pixels.

- Frustratingly, there isn't a single cause for this phenonenon. They can be triggered by lots of different things. Some examples:

	-   An element has an explicit width that is too large to fit in the parent container.
	    
	-   A replaced element (eg. a video or an image) is used without constraining its width to fit in the parent container.
	    
	-   A really long word like “disestablishmentarianism” forces an element to be too wide for its parent container.
	    
	-   An element is explicitly pulled outside of the parent (positioned elements with negative left/right values, elements with negative margin, etc).
    

- Our first step when solving these sorts of issues is to find the specific element causing the overflow, and fix it so that it stops doing that.

- Our second (and often neglected) step is to try and find a way to prevent this issue from reoccuring.
