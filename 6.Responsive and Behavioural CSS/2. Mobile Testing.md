# Mobile Testing

- If you currently use a high-end smartphone, I highly suggest spending a week or two using a low-end Android phone as your "daily driver".

## Local development flows

We'll need to set up 2 distinct superpowers:

-   The ability to access  `localhost`  on our phone
    
-   The ability to "remote debug", by opening the devtools for our mobile browser on our desktop machine.

### Accessing localhost

- The best method I've found is to use a tunnelling service like  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

- ngrok is software that you run on your development machine. It will burrow through your firewall and router and make a specified port publicly-available. It provides a randomly-generated URL that you can visit on your phone, which'll forward you to your localhost server.

- ngrok is cross-platform (MacOS, Windows, and Linux). There is a paid version, but the free tier is more than sufficient for what we need.

You can install ngrok via NPM. Follow the “Global Install” instructions:

-   [ngrok on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok#global-install)
    

Once it's set up, you ought to be able to open a terminal and run:

```ngrok http 3000```

- Replace the number “3000” with the port that your application runs on. If you typically visit  `http://localhost:8000`, you'll want to use 8000 instead.

- The “Forwarding” field shows us a URL we can visit. In this case, visiting `http://ff2b68d21f8e.ngrok.io` will load `http://localhost:3000`. I can visit this URL on my phone, or a tablet, or a computer running a different OS.

### Remote debugging

- **Remote debugging**  is the process of using our desktop developer tools to inspect a browser tab running on our mobile device.

- The instructions will vary by phone type and desktop operating system.

### Android phones
- The most up-to-date instructions will be found in this article: [“Remote Debug Android Devices”](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/).

### iOS phones

- To debug an iOS device, we need to start by enabling remote debugging in the iPhone settings.  [Follow the official WebKit instructions](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/enabling-web-inspector/#ios-device)  to get this enabled.

- It's called [“Inspect Browser”](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspect-browser/id1203594958#?platform=iphone), and it's a mobile browser that adds familiar-looking developer tools to iOS Safari.
