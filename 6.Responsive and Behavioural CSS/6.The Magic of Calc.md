# The Magic of Calc

- We can use 4 mathematical operators:

	-   `+`  (addition)
	-   `-`  (subtraction)
	-   `*`  (multiplication)
	-   `/`  (division)
	    

- **Why would we want to do this?**  For starters, it can be useful for “showing your work”. For example, which of these two declarations make it clearer that you want  `.something`  to take up 1/7th of the available space?

```css
.something  {
  width:  14.286%;
  width:  calc(100%  /  7);
}
```
- The  _real_  magic of  `calc`, though, is that  **it allows us to mix units:**

```css
.something  {
  width:  calc(50%  +  32px);
}
```
- When I first learned of this property, I thought it would solve  _so many_  layout challenges. In practice, though, I've found that I don't find myself reaching for it that often for tweaking layout properties.

- The more-practical benefit of  `calc`  comes when we  **combine it with CSS variables.**
