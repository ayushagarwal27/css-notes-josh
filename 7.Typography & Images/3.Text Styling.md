# Text Styling

## Line length

- Most sources agree that the acceptable range is  [between 50 and 75 characters per line](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability).

- Fortunately, CSS has a built-in unit for this purpose—the  `ch`  unit:

```html
<style>
  p {
    max-width: 50ch;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
  }
</style>
```

- `1ch`  is equal to the width of the  `0`  character, at the current font size.

- Does setting a width of  `50ch`  mean that we'll get an average of 50 characters per line? Not exactly. Depending on your font, the  `0`  character might be significantly thinner or thicker than average.

- On this platform, I use a font called  [Wotfard](https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/wotfard). Wotfard's “0” is chunky: I've found that 50ch creates line lengths around 70 characters long.

- Ultimately, we don't need to be  _too_  precise here. As long as we're somewhere near the sweet spot of 50-75 characters, our users will have a pleasant reading experience.

## Text alignment

- `text-align: center`  moves all of the individual characters to the middle of each line, the way you'd expect centering to work in a rich text editor.

- `align-items`, though, is more about layout alignment. It positions  _the paragraph as a block_. It doesn't affect the individual characters within that block.
