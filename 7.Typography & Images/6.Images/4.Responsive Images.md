# Responsive Images

- modern screens come in all sorts of configurations and densities. A new iPhone has a 3-to-1 ratio between hardware and software pixels. These are known as "high-DPI" displays.

- If we render an image at its native size, it's going to be fuzzy on a high-DPI display. To keep things crisp, we need to serve different images depending on the screen's pixel ratio.

- When exporting assets from the design tool, it's common to export 2 or 3 versions of the image. The ratio is generally included in the filename, like this:

	-   `cat.jpg`  (300 × 300)	
	-   `cat@2x.jpg`  (600 × 600)
	-   `cat@3x.jpg`  (900 × 900)

## The srcset attribute

- The quickest way to get up and running with responsive images is to use the  `srcset`  HTML attribute:

```html
<img
  alt=""
  src="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png"
  srcset="
    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png 1x,
    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@2x.png 2x,
    https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@3x.png 3x
  "
/>
```
- `rcset`  is essentially a "plural" version of  `src`. The browser will scan through the list and apply the first one that matches.

- We keep a redundant  `src`  property strictly for older browsers:  `srcset`  enjoys  [universal browser support](https://caniuse.com/srcset)  amongst modern browsers, but the  `src`  attribute ensures that IE users will still see our images.

- To help debug, the browser devtools will let you know which source is currently being served if you hover over the URL in the  _Elements_  pane

## The picture element

- There's another way to solve the same problem: the  `<picture>`  element!

- Here's what that looks like:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="
      https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png 1x,
      https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@2x.png 2x,
      https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond@3x.png 3x
    "
  />
  <img
    alt=""
    src="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/cfj-mats/responsive-diamond.png"
  />
</picture>
```

- The benefit to this approach is that we can specify _multiple sources_. This allows us to supply different file formats

- `<picture>`  allows us to use modern image formats in a safe way, by providing fallbacks for other browsers.

- When the browser encounters a  `<picture>`  tag, it scans through the  `<source>`  children, and the individual paths within  `srcset`.  **The order matters:**  When the browser finds a match, it will download the image from the server and show it to the user. We want our smallest files (AVIF) to be on top.

### Styling and targeting picture elements
- First, we should ignore  `<source>`  tags from a styling perspective. They're essentially metadata: they aren't visible, and shouldn't be targeted.

- Next, it's important to understand that no matter which source is selected, the  `<img>`  tag will always be used, and it acts like any other image tag. The sources exist to "swap out" the  `src`  attribute. We want to add additional properties, like alt text, to the  `<img>`  tag, and not to  `<picture>`  or  `<source>`.
- Finally, the  `<picture>`  element behaves like a  `<span>`, an inline wrapper that wraps around the  `<img>`  tag

* This  `<picture>`  wrapper comes in handy. For example, we can use it to our advantage inside a Flex container
