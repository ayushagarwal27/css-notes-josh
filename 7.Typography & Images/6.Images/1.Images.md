# Images

## About the img tag

- The  `img`  HTML tag has two required attributes:
	
	-   `src`
	-   `alt`

- `alt`  is a property that allows you to specify "alternative text". It's meant to serve as a description of what the image contains.

- Not all images require alternative text. If the image is purely decorative and has no semantic value, you can specify  `alt=""`  to indicate that screen readers can ignore it.

- How do we know if an image is semantically valuable? I try and imagine what the user experience would be like if the image failed to load. If I don't know what's depicted in the image, would it make the product harder to use? If so, it definitely requires alt text.

- In some cases, an image isn't critical to the user experience, but it still provides value. For example, Wikipedia articles include relevant photos. While the article still makes sense without these photos, they provide valuable context, and should be described with alt text.

- If you're not sure if an image qualifies as decorative or not, it's best to err on the safe side, and add alt text. Folks using screen readers can easily skip past images, so don't worry about "polluting" the experience for them!

### Writing effective alt text

- There is a lot of confusion around how to write effective alternative text.

- The goal with alternative text should be to convey the  _semantic meaning_  of the image to the user.

- If we can't see the layout of the page, though, we don't have that context

-  So we need to provide it in the alt text.

Here's what I'd set it to:
```html
<img
  alt="Octo Analytics logo - Home"
  src="/logo.png"
/>
```
- We're letting the user know that it's a logo, and that it leads to the homepage. It's the same context that sighted users take for granted.

- Interestingly, this means that the exact same image might have _totally_ different alt text depending on the circumstances. The alt text depends on the context the image is used in, not just the contents of the image.

- The important thing is that you're writing alt text with the right goal in mind. You're not simply describing images for people who can't see them. You're trying to provide the context needed so that people can navigate and use your website / web application.

## img vs. background-image

- In addition to the  `<img>`  tag, there's another common way to use images on the web: as a background image, through the  `background-image`  CSS declaration.

- The  `background-image`  property is meant to be used for, well, backgrounds!
