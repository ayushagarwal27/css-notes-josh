# Fit and Position

- `img`  is known as a "replaced element". Unlike other DOM nodes, the browser replaces the  `<img>`  tag with a foreign entity: the image itself. Images aren't like other DOM nodes, and they don't always follow the rules.

- For example, images are inline elements, and inline elements "go with the flow"; we generally can't give an inline element a  `height`, since that would mess with the layout. And yet, images can be given a height.

- Images come with their own intrinsic size, based on the dimensions of the image file.

- Images also have an _intrinsic aspect ratio_. This means that if we only supply one dimension, either `width` or `height`, the other dimension scales up or down as-needed, to preserve the aspect ratio

- What happens if we provide both a width  _and_  a height? What if it doesn't match the image's natural aspect ratio?

- By default, the image will distort, stretching like a sock being pulled over a foot

- This default behaviour is almost never what we want it to do. A better alternative in most cases is to crop the image, trimming off any excess that can't fit in the specified rectangle.

```css
object-fit: cover; /* fills the container and preserves aspect ration of image, trim excess parts */
object-fit: contain; /* gaps in image, scales down image to preserve aspect ratio of image */
object-fit: fill; /* default */
object-fit: none; /* scales image to natural-size and crops extra parts */
```
 **“Object”?**

- The  `object-fit`  property works on images, but it isn't exclusive to images: it can also be used on  `<video>`  tags!

- In general, it's less relevant with videos, but it can come in handy when working with "video GIFs"

### Object Position

- When using an  `object-fit`  value like  `cover`, the browser will crop our image so that we see the very center of the image, and trim off the edges. But in some cases, we'll want to use a different anchor point.

- `object-position`  lets us specify how the image should be translated or cropped within its available space. It's very similar to  `background-position`, if you're familiar with that property.

- In its purest form,  `object-position`  takes two numbers: one for the horizontal offset, and one for the vertical offset.

- We can also use keywords:

```css
.thing  {
	/* Anchor to the top-left corner */
	/* Same as "0% 0%" */
	object-position: left top;
}
```
