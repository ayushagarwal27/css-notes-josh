# Wrapping

- We saw how  `inline`  elements in Flow layout have a super-power:  [they can line-wrap](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/01-rendering-logic-1/09-flow-layout#inline-elements-can-line-wrap). 

- In Flexbox, a similar concept exists, via the  `flex-wrap`  property.

- We can give ( flex: 1 1 min-width size ) and ( max-width: size ).

## Content vs. items

- Content - group
- Items - managed individually

**Two dimensions**

- Before this lesson, all of the examples we've seen have existed in a single dimension.  `flex-wrap`  allows us to dip our toes into two-dimensional layouts.

- Ultimately, however, we aren't going to go  _too_  deep into this. The reason is that CSS Grid offers a more compelling story for two-dimensional layouts.

```html
<style>
  main {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  article {
    flex: 1 1 150px;
    max-width: 250px;
  }
  article img {
    width: 100%;
  }
</style>
```
