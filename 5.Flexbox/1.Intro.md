# Flexbox

-   Flexbox is one of many “layout modes” in CSS, like  [Flow layout](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/01-rendering-logic-1/09-flow-layout)  or  [Positioned layout](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/02-rendering-logic-2/01-positioning).
    
-   Flexbox is most handy when we have a set of things, and we want to control their distribution along a  _primary axis_, either horizontally or vertically.
    
-   **Flexbox is still relevant,**  even with CSS Grid reaching wide browser support. It's a different tool for a different job: CSS Grid works best for two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox offers more flexibility for working with a single dimension.
    
-   When we apply  `display: flex`  to an element, we toggle the "Flexbox" layout algorithm for the element's  _children_. The parent element will still use Flow layout.
