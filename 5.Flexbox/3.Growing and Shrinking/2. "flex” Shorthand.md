# The “flex” Shorthand

-   `flex`  takes 3 individual values:
    
    -   `flex-grow`, as a unitless value (eg.  `1`)
    -   `flex-shrink`, as a unitless value (eg.  `5`)
    -   `flex-basis`, as a length unit (eg.  `200px`)
        
    
-   By default,  `flex-grow`  will distribute any  _extra_  space that isn't taken up by the elements.
    
-   `flex: 1`  will assign  `flex-grow: 1`, but it will  _also_  set  `flex-basis: 0`. It won't affect the default value for  `flex-shrink`, which is  `1`.
    
-   Since  `flex-basis`  is a synonym for  `width`  in a flex row, we're effectively shrinking each child to have a “hypothetical width” of 0px, and then distributing all of the space between each child.
