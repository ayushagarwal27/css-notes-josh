## Constraints

- We've seen how properties like  `flex-grow`,  `flex-shrink`, and  `flex-basis`  can be used to control the  _proportions_  between siblings in a flex container.

- What if we want to set hard limits, though, rather than ratios?

- Fortunately, a familiar set of properties can help us out here:  `min-width`/`max-width`  and  `min-height`/`max-height`.

- In a flex row,  `flex-basis`  works just like  `width`, and it  _also_  respects the constraints set by  `min-width`  and  `max-width`.

- We're effectively changing the “minimum content size” to be a hardcoded value, rather than relying on the size of the element's children.

- We can also use  `max-width`  to clamp an element's growth! And, in a column,  `min-height`  and  `max-height`  work the same way.

## Shorthand Gotchas

To summarize: when we use the  `flex`  shorthand, we set  `flex-basis`  to  `0`, and  _this value will override any  `width`  you set_. In other words,  `width`  has no effect in this snippet (when used inside a  `flex-direction: row`  container):
```css
.item  {
  flex:  1;
  width:  200px;
}
```
To prevent this unwanted surprise, we should instead use  `flex-basis`. And if you need to set either  `flex-grow`  or  `flex-shrink`, you should use the shorthand:
```css
.item  {
  flex:  1  1  200px;
}
```
