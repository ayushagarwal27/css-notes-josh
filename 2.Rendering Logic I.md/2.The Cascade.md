  
# The Cascade

Consider the following bit of CSS and HTML:
```html
<style>
  p  {
  font-weight: bold;
  color:  hsl(0deg  0%  10%);
  }

  .introduction  {
  color:  violet;
  }

</style>
<p  class="introduction">
 Hello world
</p>
```

- We've created two rules, one targeting a tag (`p`), another targeting a class (`introduction`). Then, we've created an HTML element that matches them both.

- You may already know what happens here: we wind up with a bold, violet paragraph. It plucks the  `font-weight`  declaration from the  `p`  tag, and the  `color`  declaration from the  `.introduction`  class.

- This example shows the browser's  _cascade algorithm_  at work.

- When the browser needs to display our introduction paragraph on the screen, it first needs to figure out which declarations apply to it. And before it can do that, it needs to collect a set of matching rules. Once it has a list of applicable rules, it works out any conflicts.

**I don't think you need to know this stuff anymore.**
- With the methodology we'll use in this course, styles are tied to components. We won't have gargantuan selectors reaching across an application. All of our styles will be colocated in one place, and _components_ will be the mechanism of reuse, not classes.
