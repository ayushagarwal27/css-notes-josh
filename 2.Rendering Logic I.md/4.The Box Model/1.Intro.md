# The Box Model

## Winter Layers
The four aspects that make up the box model are:

 1. Content 
 2. Padding 
 3. Border 
 4. Margin


## Box Sizing

- The `box-sizing` CSS property allows us to change the rules for size calculations. The default value (`content-box`) only takes the inner content into account, not border and padding, but it offers an alternative value: `border-box`.

- border-box - takes padding, border into box size consideration 

### A new default

- Instead of having to remember to swap box-sizing on every layout element, we can set it as the default value for  _all_  elements with this handy CSS snippet:
```css
*,
*::before,
*::after  {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

**Why the pseudo-elements?**

-  You might be wondering: why do we need to add  `*::before`  and  `*::after`? Shouldn't the wildcard selector (`*`) select  _everything_?

- Well, yes and no. The  `*`  selector will select all  _elements_, but  `::before`  and  `::after`  aren't considered elements. They're  _pseudo_-elements. And so we need to select them explicitly.
