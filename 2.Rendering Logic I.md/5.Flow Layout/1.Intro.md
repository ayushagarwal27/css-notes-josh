# Flow Layout

- Every HTML element will have its layout calculated by a layout algorithm. These are known as _“**layout** **modes**”_, and there are 7 distinct ones.

- Flow layout is the default layout mode. Everything we've seen so far has used Flow layout. A plain HTML document, with no CSS applied, uses Flow layout exclusively.

- I like to think of Flow layout as the “Microsoft Word” layout algorithm. It's intended to be used for document type layouts.
- There are two main element types in Flow layout:

	-   **Block elements:**  things like headings, paragraphs, footers, asides. The chunks of content that make up a page.
    
	-   **Inline elements:**  things like links, or a string of bold text. Generally, inline elements are meant to highlight bits of text, or elements within a block container.
    

- Each HTML tag has a default type.  `<div>`  and  `<header>`  are block elements,  `span`  and  `<a>`  are inline elements.

- We can toggle any particular element with the  `display`  property:

```css
/* Transform a particular <a> tag from `inline` to `block`: */
a.nav-link  {
  display: block;
}
```
- In flow layout, block elements stack in the block direction, and inline elements stack in the inline direction.

## Inline elements don't want to make a fuss
- You can picture inline elements as go-with-the-flow-type folks. They don't want to inconvenience anyone by pushing any boundaries.

- You _can_ shift things in the inline direction with `margin-left` and `margin-right`, since that pushes it around in the _inline_ direction, but you can't give it a `width` or `height`. When it comes to layout, an inline element is where it is, and there's not much we can do about it.

**Replaced elements**

- There's an exception to this rule:  _replaced elements_.

- A replaced element is one that embeds a "foreign" object. This includes:

	-   `<img />`	    
	-   `<video />`
	-   `<canvas />`
	    
- These elements are all technically inline, but they're special: they  _can_  affect block layout. You can give them explicit dimensions, or add some  `margin-top`.

- How do we reconcile this? I have a trick. I like to pretend that it's a foreign object within an inline wrapper. When you pass it a width or height, you're applying those properties  _to the foreign object_. The inline wrapper still goes with the flow.

## Block elements don't share
- When you place a block level element on the page, its content box greedily expands to fill the entire available horizontal space.

- Elements that are `display: block` will stack in the block direction, regardless of their size.

## Inline elements have “magic space”
- The reason for this extra “magic space” is that the browser treats inline elements as if they're typography. It makes sense that with text, you'd want a bit of extra space, so that the lines in a paragraph aren't crammed in too tightly.

- There are two ways we can fix this problem:

	1.  Set images to  `display: block`  — if you're noticing this problem, there's a good chance your images aren't interspersed with text, so setting them to display as blocks makes sense.
    
	2.  Set the  `line-height`  on the wrapping div to  `0`:

- This space is proportional to the height of each line, so if we reduce the line height to 0, this “magic space” goes away. Because our container doesn't contain any text, this property has no other effect.

### Space between inline elements

- This space is caused by the **whitespace between elements**. If we squish our HTML so that there are no newlines or whitespace characters between images

- This happens because HTML is _space-sensitive_, at least to an extent. The browser can't tell the difference between whitespace added to separate words in a paragraph, and whitespace added to indent our HTML and keep it readable.

- This issue is specific to Flow layout. Other layout modes, like Flexbox, ignore whitespace altogether. So, the simplest thing is to switch the container to use Flexbox.

## Inline elements can line-wrap

- Inline elements have one pretty big trick up their sleeves; they can line-wrap.

- Unlike block elements, an inline element can produce shapes other than boxes

- This helps explain why certain CSS properties aren't available for inline elements. What would it even mean to increase the vertical margin on a shape like this?

- It's worth noting that it's still considered "one shape". If we add a border, we can see that we don't get 2 discrete rectangles, but rather a single rectangle cut in half and repositioned.

- **I like to think of it like a sushi roll.** We have one long strip of text, and it's chopped up into individual bite-sized lines before being presented.

## The deal with inline-block

- An `inline-block` element is a block-level element that can be placed in an inline context.

- In terms of layout, it's treated as an inline element. We can drop it in the middle of a paragraph, without totally borking the layout. But _internally_, it acts much more like a block element.

- Usually, properties like `width` and `margin-top` have no effect on an inline element, but they _do_ work on inline-block elements.

### Inline-block doesn't line-wrap
- **Here's the big downside with inline-block:** It disables line-wrapping.
- Descriptive link text is [important for accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2019-02-15-creating-valid-and-accessible-links/). Therefore, we should only use effects like this when the links aren't part of a paragraph (eg. navigation links).
