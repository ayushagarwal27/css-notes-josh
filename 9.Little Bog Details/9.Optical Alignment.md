# Optical Alignment

- Instead of aligning things based on the mathematical values, we should align things based on their _perceived symmetry_. This is known as **optical alignment.**

- In design software, text nodes will have a  _tiny_  amount of space around them (the reason there's more space along the bottom is for letters that descend, like  `j`  or  `p`).

- This is why our implementation won't quite look right even if we use the  _exact same values_  that we see listed in Figma! The numbers can't be trusted, because typography is handled differently between design software and the web.

## Utility components

- For shifting individual elements around, like the number in the notification badge, I created a utility component:

```js
function  ShiftBy({
	x =  0,
	y =  0,
	children,
	as  =  "div",
	style =  {},
	...delegated
})  {
	const  Element  =  as;
	return  (
		<Element
			style={{  transform:  `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`  }}
			{...delegated}
		>
			{children}
		</Element>
		);
}
```

- This component is used like this:

```js
<Notifications>
	<ShiftBy  y={1}>
	  {numOfNotifications}
	</ShiftBy>
</Notifications>
```

- Having a utility component makes it easy to make quick adjustments for optical alignment.

- In cases where we need to cancel some padding, like the "Hello World" heading example, we should use negative margin instead of  `transform: translate`. This component could be updated to support either transforms or negative margins to make it even more useful
