# Focus Within

- Using child selectors, it's possible to style a descendant when an ancestor is focused:

```html
<style>
  a:focus .highlighted {
    background: hsl(55deg 100% 75%);
  }
</style>

<a href="/"> Focus me and <span class="highlighted">see the magic!</span> </a>
```

- This is a pattern we've seen a few times in this course; when a parent has a hover/focus/active state, apply some CSS to a child.

- But what if we wanted to do the opposite? What if we wanted to apply a style to the _parent_ when a _child_ is focused?

- We can solve this with CSS now, using the `:focus-within` pseudoclass!

## In practice

- The most common use case for `:focus-within` is forms:

Unfortunately, there are no equivalents for other states (eg. `:hover-within`).
