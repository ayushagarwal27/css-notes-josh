# Focus Outlines

- The  `outline`  property is a bit sneaky.

- When we apply outline styles to a non-interactive element, like a  `<div>`  or a  `<p>`, it essentially acts like a border. It takes on a solid color with hard edges.

- Non-interactive outlines will look the same across all browsers and devices, just like a border.

- When we focus an  _interactive_  element, though, we're treated to a browser-specific “focus outline”.

## Customizing focus outlines

- What happens if we change the  `outline-color`  property of a focus outline?

```html
<style>
  a {
    outline-color: red;
  }
</style>
```

- Focus outlines are a tried-and-true convention, one that users have come to expect. The default styling is instantly recognizable as a focus indicator. The non-focus outlines look more like borders, and people don't associate borders with focus. That's my opinion on the matter, at least.

- For browsers that support it, changing  `outline-color`  alone is a happy compromise. We can tailor the focus indicator to our app's theme without fundamentally changing it. A red focus outline is still recognizable as a focus outline.

- As we've said many times in this course, we should be OK with different people having different experiences, so long as each person has a good experience. We can still use  `outline-color`  even though it isn't supported in all browsers because our application is fully usable either way.
