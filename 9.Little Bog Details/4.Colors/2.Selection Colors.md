# Selection Colors

- By default, when we select text, a blue background is applied

- We can tweak both the background and text color for the selection box using the `::selection` pseudo-element:

```html
<style>
  ::selection {
    color: red;
    background-color: hsl(55deg 100% 60%);
  }
</style>
```

## Tweaking selection styles by element

- Sometimes, you may wish to use different selection styles for different elements on the page, rather than a single "global" selection style.

- Setting this up, however, is surprisingly tricky because _selection styles aren't inheritable_.
- That said, there's a pretty slick workaround, using CSS variables:

```html
<style>
  ::selection {
    color: var(--selection-color);
    background-color:
      var(--selection-background);
  }
  
  html {
    /*
      Define global defaults
      for selection colors…
    */
    --selection-color:
      hsl(25deg 100% 20%);
    --selection-background:
      hsl(55deg 100% 60%);
  }
  
  figure {
    /*
      …But then override those values
      for specific parts of the page!
    */
    --selection-color: hsl(0deg 0% 0%);
    --selection-background:
      hsl(333deg 100% 50%);
  }
</style>
```

- Essentially, every element on the page has the exact same `::selection` styles, but they rely on CSS variables rather than hardcoded values. When we change the value of a CSS variable, the selection styles change, _for that element and all of its descendants._

**Accessibility concerns(warning)**

- There are valid accessibility concerns when it comes to overriding default selection styles.

- Changing the default selection styles can cause confusion, especially amongst people who are still developing technological literacy, as well as those with cognitive disabilities.

- Personally, because I build products that are aimed at software developers, I'm comfortable tweaking the default selection colors. But you'll need to consider your own product's audience, and see if the benefits outweigh the risks.

- It's also important to check that the color and background color are sufficiently high-contrast,
