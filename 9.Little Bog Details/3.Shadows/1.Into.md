# Shadows

## Tools of the trade

- There are three main ways to apply shadows in CSS:  `box-shadow`,  `text-shadow`, and  `filter: drop-shadow`.

### box-shadow

- `box-shadow`  is the most common way to apply shadows in CSS.

- It's based on the box model. When you apply  `box-shadow`  to an element, that element's box will cast a simulated shadow behind it.

- `box-shadow`  is most commonly called with 4 arguments:

	1.  Horizontal offset
	2.  Vertical offset
	3.  Blur radius
	4.  Color

- The blur radius is the strength of the blurring effect.

- The color can be any valid color value, but I strongly recommend using  `hsl`/`hsla`. Using a solid color like  `black`  produces a  _very_  aggressive shadow. We want to be more subtle than that.

```html
<style>
  .card {
    box-shadow:
      2px 40px 100px hsl(0deg 0% 0% / 0.25);
  }
</style>
```

 ### filter: drop-shadow

- As we've seen, the  `filter`  property allows us to access SVG filter mechanics from within the CSS language.  `drop-shadow`  is one of those filters!

```html
<style>
  .card {
    filter: drop-shadow(
      2px 4px 8px hsl(0deg 0% 0% / 0.25)
    );
  }
</style>
```

- The API looks quite similar: it also accepts 4 values, of the same types, in the same order. They aren't quite the same thing, though

- `filter` produces a softer, more-blended shadow.

### text-shadow

- `text-shadow`  is a shadow that applies only to the typography within the selected element.

```html
<style>
  p {
    text-shadow:
      2px 4px 8px hsl(0deg 0% 0% / 0.25);
  }
</style>
```
- One of the most common use cases for `text-shadow` is to increase the contrast between light-coloured text and a light background.
