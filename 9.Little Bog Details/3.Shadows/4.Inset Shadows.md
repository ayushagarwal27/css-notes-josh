# Inset Shadows

- There's one more nifty trick exclusive to `box-shadow`: we can use it to create inner shadows!

```html
<style>
  .wrapper {
    box-shadow:
      inset
      2px 2px 8px
      hsl(0deg 0% 0% / 0.33);
  }
</style>
```

- Inset shadows allow us to create the illusion that an element is _lower_ than its surrounding environment. This can be a very useful tool!
