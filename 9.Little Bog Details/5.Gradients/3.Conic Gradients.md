# Conic Gradients

- Conic gradients are what would happen if you took a straight line with a linear gradient, and formed it into a circle

```css
 background-image: conic-gradient(
      deeppink,
      red,
      coral,
      gold, lime
 );
```

## Smoothing it out

- By default, we wind up with a pretty harsh line running vertically through the top half. This is because our start and end colors are so different! Unlike the other gradient functions, we don't get a seamless blended result automatically with conic gradients.

- If our gradient ends with the same color it started with, we can create a smoother effect

## Gradient angle and position

- Linear gradients are given an angle (eg.  `45deg`), and radial gradients are given a position (`circle at 50% 100%`). Conic gradients take both.

The format is as follows:

``` from <angle> at <position>```
