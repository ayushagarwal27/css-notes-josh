# Radial Gradients

- A radial gradient emanates outwards in a circle from a single point

```css
background-image: radial-gradient(deeppink, red, coral, gold, white);
```

- In some ways, the different gradient functions in CSS are quite similar. They all work on the principle of accepting multiple color stops and hints, and interpolating color between them.

- They do have some differences, though!

- The optional first argument for radial gradients is a bit funky. It's sort-of a position, sort-of a size.

```css
background-image: radial-gradient(50% 50%, deeppink, gold);
```

- We're saying that the gradient's "core" should span half of the available width, and the full height. This creates a tall, skinny ellipse.

- Circular radial gradients can "lock in" the shape using the `circle at` prefix

```css
background-image: radial-gradient(
  circle at 50% 100%,
  white 0%,
  yellow 10%,
  gold 20%,
  coral 30%,
  skyblue
);
```

- Here's how this works: we're creating a circular gradient centered at `(50%, 100%)` â€” the midpoint along the bottom edge. The colors radiate outwards from this point, and I use color stop percentages to define the shape I want.
