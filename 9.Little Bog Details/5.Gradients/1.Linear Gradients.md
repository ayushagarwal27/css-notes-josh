# Linear Gradients

- If we provide two colors to `linear-gradient`, it will interpolate between them, starting from the top and going down

- If we want the gradient to run at a different angle, we can pass that as an optional first argument:

```html
<style>
  .box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 3px solid;
    background-image: linear-gradient(30deg, deeppink, gold);
  }
</style>
```

- Somewhat confusingly, the default angle for gradients is `180deg`. If we set it to `0deg`, the gradient would run from the bottom to the top.

- As a neat bit of sugar, we can also specify cardinal directions with the `to` keyword:

```css
.box {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, color1, color2);
  /* Is equivalent to: */
  background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, color1, color2);
}
```

- We can pass more than two colors, to create richer gradients:

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(
  90deg,
  deeppink,
  red,
  coral,
  gold,
  white,
  tomato
);
```

- Gradients have "color stops", points along the spectrum where the color is fully applied. By default, these colors will be equidistant

- We can change their placement, though, using percentages:

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(
  90deg,
  deeppink,
  red 10%,
  coral 20%,
  gold 30%,
  white
);
```

- We can use color stops to do something pretty neat and unexpected: we can create _sharp lines_ by positioning the stops very close together

## Gradient hints

In addition to color _stops_, we also have color _hints_. A color hint allows us to move the midpoint between two colors:

```css
.box.one {
  background-image: linear-gradient(deeppink, 20%, gold);
}
```

- Normally, the midpoint between two colors is halfway through the space between color stops. Hints allow us to shift that midpoint
