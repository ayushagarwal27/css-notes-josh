# Pointer Events

## Disabling pointer events

- The  `pointer-events`  property allows us to set an element to be a hologram: you can see it, but you can't touch it.

```html
<style>
  button {
    pointer-events: none;
  }
</style>
```

- We can still focus the button using the keyboard, and we can still select the text in some browsers. But we can't trigger a click event on it. Clicks pass right through.

- Here's the really wild thing, though:  **we can ‘undo’ pointer-events in descendants!**

- We can set a parent to ignore pointer-events, but then restore the default value (`auto`) to a child. The child will support clicks/taps, but the parent won't.

```html
<style>
  .toast-wrapper {
    pointer-events: none;
  }
  
  .toast {
    pointer-events: auto;
  }
</style>
```

- The  `.toast-wrapper`  will ignore clicks, so that we can click the  `.random`  button behind it. But its child,  `.toast`  will happily accept pointer interactions.

- Being able to selectively ignore clicks  _without_  locking anything in for the element's descendants is a pretty wild super-power.
