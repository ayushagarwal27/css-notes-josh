# Horizontal Overflow

- So far, all of the examples we've seen involve _vertical_ overflow. But what if we want data to overflow in the alternative direction?

- How can we instruct the container to _not_ linewrap, and instead to leave the content in a single line? The `white-space` property has got our back:
```html
<style>
  .wrapper {
    overflow: auto;
    border: 3px solid;
    /* The secret ingredient: */
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
</style>
```
- `white-space`  is a property that lets us tweak how words and other inline/inline-block elements wrap. By setting it to  `nowrap`, we instruct the container to never break lines. That, in tandem with  `overflow: auto`, allows us to achieve a horizontally-scrollable element.
