# Overflow -  Positioned Layout

## Overflow and containing blocks

- Absolutely-positioned elements act just like static-positioned elements when it comes to overflow. If the parent sets `overflow: auto`, _as long as that parent is the containing block_, it will allow that child to be scrolled into view

```html
<style>
.wrapper {
  position: relative;
  overflow: auto;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  border: 3px solid;
}
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 24px;
  background: deeppink;
  width: 150px;
  height: 200px;
}
</style>

<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="box" />
</div>
```
- This is pretty surprising! In general, absolute positioning is ignored by standard layout algorithms, and yet `overflow: auto` treats it just like any other element!

## Fixed positioning

- In order for a child to "trigger" the overflow, it needs to be contained by it. Setting  `position: relative`  is enough to contain an absolute child, but  _fixed_  children are only ever contained by the “initial containing block”, a box that exists outside the DOM structure.

- In other words:  `.wrapper`  will only add a scrollbar when one of its  _contained_  children spills out of its bounds. But regular ol' HTML elements can't contain fixed children.

- Similarly, this also means that fixed-position elements are immune from being hidden with  `overflow: hidden`
